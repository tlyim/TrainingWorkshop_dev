    - The dot (`.`) in Python is the **attribute access operator**, used to access _attributes_ or _methods_ of an object. In `stock_AAPL.balance_sheet`, it accesses the `balance_sheet` attribute (a pandas DataFrame) of the stock_AAPL object.

    - `.iloc` is a pandas DataFrame method for **integer-location based indexing**.

This returns a pandas Series for that column.

    _**Follow-up question to ask:**_ _What is a pandas Series?_

    - A pandas Series is a **one-dimensional labeled array** in Python, capable of holding any data type (integers, floats, strings, etc.). Each value in a Series has an associated label called an **index**.
      - You can think of it as a column in a spreadsheet or a dictionary with ordered keys and values. **Series** are a core data structure in the pandas library and are used for data analysis and manipulation.

    Major Variants of mo.ui in Marimo
    Marimo's mo.ui module offers various interactive UI elements for notebooks. Here are the major variants (widgets) for user input and interaction:

    mo.ui.text(): Text input field (e.g., for strings like tickers).
    mo.ui.number(): Numeric input field (supports integers/floats with optional min/max).
    mo.ui.slider(): Horizontal slider for selecting a number within a range.
    mo.ui.dropdown(): Single-select dropdown menu from a list of options.
    mo.ui.multiselect(): Multi-select dropdown for choosing multiple items.
    mo.ui.checkbox(): Boolean checkbox (true/false toggle).
    mo.ui.radio(): Radio button group for single selection from options.
    mo.ui.button(): Clickable button to trigger actions or re-runs.
    mo.ui.date(): Date picker for selecting dates.
    mo.ui.file(): File uploader for handling file inputs.
    mo.ui.table(): Editable table for data entry or display.
    mo.ui.array(): Input for arrays/lists of values.
    mo.ui.dictionary(): Input for key-value pairs (dictionaries).
    mo.ui.form(): Container to group multiple UI elements into a form.
    Each widget can be displayed using mo.md() and supports reactive updates. For examples and parameters, refer to the Marimo UI documentation.
